Introduction to Django and python

### How it works and why should I learn it?

Learning Python can be extremely useful for penetration testers, and a simple understanding of its frameworks can be a key to success.

Django is a high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable websites. It allows you to develop websites and web applications in a matter of hours.

Django can automatically compile HTML code, therefore making it possible for anyone without any advanced knowledge in markup languages to develop a website. Additionally, Django is arguably one of the most secure developing frameworks, which in the right configuration, can strongly resist against SQL injections and XSS.

All in all, if you are familiar with Python and considering creating a website, Django can be a really good choice. As for penetration tester, it is important to understand the basic structure of Django-powered websites in order to be able to identify possible weaknesses and mistakes a developer can make.
